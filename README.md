# MarkovChainSim

This Markov Chain Simulator is a web-based tool that allows you to visualize and simulate Markov chains. Markov chains are mathematical models used to describe random processes where the outcome of a system depends only on its current state, making them valuable for a wide range of applications, from physics to finance.
